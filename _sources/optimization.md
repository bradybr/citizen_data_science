# Optimization

There are some consistant features of these models and methods you'll want to learn if you're planning on playing in this space, such as Decision Variables, Constraints, and Objective Function, but with a little practice and repitition under your belt, you'll get it.

There are many more sophisticated areas contained under this heading that are beyond the scope of our learning objectives, but you may want to look into the following if you have any interest in further study.

- Linear Programming
- Markov Decision Processes
- Reinforcement Learning
- Dynamic Programming
- Stochastic Optimization
