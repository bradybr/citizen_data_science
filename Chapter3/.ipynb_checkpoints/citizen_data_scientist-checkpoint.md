It's now time to introduce the hero of our story.

Recall the subtitle of this course, _Anyone Can Find Value Through Advanced Analytics_.  It does not take an astronomical investment or building a team of PhDs from MIT to build a robust analytical community within an organization.  Chances are you already have the talent working in-role right now.  It simply takes an investment in time and energy to unlock and enhance what these resources are capable of.

Essentially what we're talking about is taking the frontline analytical resources you already possess within your business analyst community, and empowering them with new machine learning super powers and capabilities.

Imagine instead of having only a few, highly trained and experienced professional data scientists delivering a handful of high-value projects each year, what if you could have 100 highly competent business analysts delivering hundreds of small to mid-value solutions each year?  Right!?!?  Now we're talking about seriously moving the value needle.
