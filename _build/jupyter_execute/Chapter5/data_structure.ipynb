The good news is there are a few ways to look at the data to easily understand what kind of information it carries to give you a nice head start on addressing any issues.  Regardless of the type of data you're working with, structures and hierarchies are generally present and convey the information required for certain types of analysis and modeling."

    "_Unit of analysis_, or level of analysis, is is first up when we start analyzing the structure of our data.  You can think of this as the details contained in a _row_ of data.  It always made sense to me to also think of it as having some kind of subject, e.g. by Customer, by Region, or by Manufacturer.  If our data has been prefiltered down to just one Customer, then you'll only have one unit/level, but it's still the highest _object_ level that everything else in the data relates to.\n",

    "For example, if we have a sales report and we have a column called \"Customer\", then I would say our unit of analysis is \"Sales, by Customer\".  We may also see nested hierarchies such as \"by Customer, by Region\".  So you might see something like - Costco as the customer, and then there are 3 Regions, Midwest, Northeast, and South, that all roll up to the Costco banner level.  You will also frequently run into having a time frame or frequency in your data as well.  So it might be something like \"by Customer, by Region, by Day\".\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all examples of the unit of analysis that map to whatever the data in your set actually is.  If it's a daily sales report, then it's \"Sales, by Customer, by Region, by Day\".  Each Customer-Region will have sales for each day for the overall time horizon of your data set.\n",
