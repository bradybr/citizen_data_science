# What Is Data Science?

Ask ten different people what Data Science is and you'll very likely get ten different answers. It's a loaded question clouded by buzz words, assumptions, egos, and domain specific interpretations.

With stability comes standardization, but unfortunately in the case of emerging innovation as with the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, you get the opposite effect: lack of standardization. These emerging fields are in a constant state of flux. Technology evolves enabling new capabilities, academia and businesses create new personas, consensus shifts on what's in and what's out under an umbrella term like Data Science, and things are forever being rebranded to recenter the focus after a field gets too messy.

Words matter.  We use them to compartmentalize and categorize.  We use them to convey information so others can understand our meaning. To the extent that we need overselves and others to comprehend what we're talking about and understand what's included and excluded, these words matter.  Beyond this comprehension I would argue, there's little practical value in endlessly debating and nit-picking the semantics and ownership of which field owns which methodology.

For our purposes, what _really_ matters at the end of the day is that you're able to:

 - Understand what other people are talking about
 - Convey your message in such a way that others are able to understand what you're talking about
 - Get to the bottom of what really matters, which is understanding the objectives, value potential, and how to solve a problem

Knowing what level of understanding we're after, let's start with one of the simplest definitions of Data Science generally seen in the wild.

> _Data Science_ is a field of study which analyzes data to find patterns and extract meaningful insights.
