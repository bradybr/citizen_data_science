# Introduction

As I sit down to write this Introduction, I'm returning from a one-day conference regarding _AI-Centric Factories of the Future_.  If I would have written this prior to, I'm pretty sure it would read differently than it's about to.  It's funny how your fundamental thinking can shift so easily sometimes.

Ever since ChatGPT blew the doors off of the public's blinders as to the possibilities with what we do, the AI hype train has gone of the rails.  Despite the hype, not much has actually changed.  To the average person who didn't know anything about us before, it may seem like this all came out of nowhere and we've hit some kind of AI singularity milestone.  The truth is, we're still doing exactly what we were doing before, just with more data, more computing power, and we've solved some of the limitations with the math we've been using since the 1950's.  So at the end of the day, what's now the bright and shiny object in the public consciousness is definitely exciting; however, it's still simply just a better natural language type of prediction model than we had yesterday.  That's all.

It seems lately everyone and their brother are talking about AI this and AI that, but at the end of the day, the core machine learning methodologies are still where companies are finding value.  AI is just an umbrella term and word that's hit crazy usage levels outside of practioner circles, that rings more nebulous than ever before.  When the rubber meets the road and you really start to dig and ask questions to find out what someone is talking about when trying to solve these advanced analytics problems, you will inevitably get to one of the common machine learning approaches we're going to cover in this course.

The intuition behind citizen data science is easy to grasp.

I've never been more convinced that analytics does not have to be complicated.  

Imagine instead of having only a few, highly trained and experienced professional data scientists delivering a handful of high-value projects each year, what if you could have 100 highly competent business analysts delivering hundreds of small to mid-value solutions each year?  Right!?!?  Now we're talking about seriously moving the value needle.

Gartner hype cycle - the possibilities will continue to far outweigh practical return, and the trough of despair will become even more pronounced





<h4>What's your elevator pitch?</h4>

Have you heard of an elevator pitch?  It's when you run into someone in an elevator and you need to sell yourself, or in this case explain something, in a very brief period of time, e.g. a 15 second elevator ride.  It's good advice to have a few of these loaded and ready when you begin running in professional circles.  For example, it's extremely common to hear something like, _"Hey Brian, haven't seen you in forever.  What have you been up to?"_.

In my case, I have to be able to explain to someone I haven't seen in 10 years that I work in data science when they have absolutely no idea what that means.  What's worse, consider that my attempt at explaining what data science is may introduce additional new terms the other party may not be aware of either (i.e. artificial intelligence, machine learning, algorithms, models).  So it's clearly not something I can give a textbook answer for in my case.

In case you're wondering, what I usually tell the uninitiated I do for a living is "I solve high value business problems, by making predictions or telling someone what they _should_ do, using advanced math and computer code."  Simple, straight forward, and just enough teaser information to hint at the unique specialities behind the scenes that set me apart from the crowd.
