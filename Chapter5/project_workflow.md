# The Project Workflow

My wife can’t stand puzzles. There isn’t really a strong enough word to describe how much she dislikes them. She loves the feeling of accomplishment, but would rather not struggle to get there.  Being a data scientist is absolutely not for her. Me on the other hand; I love the feeling of challenging myself with the impossible. Somehow it makes the satisfaction of accomplishment that much sweeter.

Anyone else really want to try this puzzle, or is it just me?

In this Chapter we’re going to get our hands dirty working with the actual steps you'll encounter when tackling a real data science project. Just like with CRISP-DM, there are some well-known and ordered steps we’re going to introduce. You won’t always need each phase, but it’s an excellent general structure to be aware of so you can take what you need and adapt to whatever your situation is.

While the steps are well defined, be aware every situation is different.  Every step along the way can throw you a curveball with different data and the nuances of your project.  We need to be vigilant and think critically with each step.  Small and seemingly minor decisions can have large repercussions for the outcome.  So unfortunately just knowing the steps is not enough.  You will need to learn how to identify when something looks "wrong" or isn't working as expected.  This will come with practice.  For now, stay inquisitive and open to the challenge of learning.  Learning through making mistakes is just part of it, and not something to let discourage you.  

So if the image of this puzzle above doesn’t turn your stomach, then that's good enough for now.  You might be one of us.  People who do well in this field enjoy difficult challenges and are excited by the prospect of doing something that everyone else says is impossible.  It won't always be easy though.  You’ll have constant challenges. You’ll hit seemingly impassable roadblocks and get stuck in endless cycles of trial and error.  Believe it or not, this is what motivates a lot of us.  If that sounds like you, then step right in. You’re going to enjoy it here.

There’s an extremely worthwhile and gratifying payoff somewhere in there when you do figure it out.  And you can figure it out.  I promise.
